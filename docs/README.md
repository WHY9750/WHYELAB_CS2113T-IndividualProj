# User Guide
Hello there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to **Duke**! **Duke** is a Task List designed to store various type of 
task like todo, event and deadline which can be displayed to the user.  

## Setting up
- The text-art folder that contains all the text-art needs to be included in the JAR directory. 
- data/duke.txt will be created in the JAR directory if it does not exist and the duke.txt must 
be kept empty.

## Features 

### Active Update

The app will actively apply the last change to the duke.txt immediately after the command is 
entered in order to prevent the loss of data or changes when an error occur such as user 
accidentally pressing CTRL + C to the terminal... 

### Anti-Duplicate

Everytime a task is added, it is checked and ensure that no 2 task is exactly the same. 

## Usage

### `todo` - Adds a todo type of Task

Adds a todo task with the specified description (after "todo") and a notification will be 
shown on the terminal to show its been successfully added. The task will also by default 
be marked as not "done".

Example of usage: 

`todo Play Apex and Valorant With Friends`

Expected outcome:

Since "Play Apex and Valorant With Friends" is the description, it is shown on the 
notification below. And the Task is not "done" [ ].
```
